# freeRTOS-semester-project
In order to properly use this code, the hardware components detailed in the report are required. Please view Project Report for detailed analysis of our implementation.

Launch the project in Atmel studio from our project folder which should already contain all necessary libraries. Running the code on the Arduino M0 with the proper hardware components connected (as detailed more in the attached project report) will produce a successful distance maintaining vehicle!  

To see data regarding response time, CPU Utilziation, and more as presented in the report. Download the Tracealyzer 4 from here: https://percepio.com/downloadform/

To setup Tracealyzer with Atmel, refer to the Tracealyzer user manual and follow the steps in the ‘Integrating the Recorder’ section.

*Disclaimer: This manual is very vague at times and does not offer all the solutions necessary, a lot of specifics will need to be looked into depending on your system and hardware. Setting Tracealyzer up is not as straightforward as it could be.
